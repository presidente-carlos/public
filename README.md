# Sharing is Caring
Most of the things I do, including coding, are of very little use for society, but, from time to time, I realize that some of those things could actually be of use for someone somewhere.
There is very little structure within this folder, but feel free to explore it.

I will be more than happy to receive any kind of pull request or comment on how to improve current applications.

Yours in the bond,

Carlos
